        The human penis is an external male intromittent organ that additionally
        serves as the urinary duct. The main parts are the root (radix); the
        body (corpus); and the epithelium of the penis including the shaft skin
        and the foreskin (prepuce) covering the glans penis. The body of the
        penis is made up of three columns of tissue: two corpora cavernosa on
        the dorsal side and corpus spongiosum between them on the ventral side.
        The human male urethra passes through the prostate gland, where it is
        joined by the ejaculatory duct, and then through the penis. The urethra
        traverses the corpus spongiosum, and its opening, the meatus, lies on
        the tip of the glans penis. It is a passage both for urination and
        ejaculation of semen (see male reproductive system.)
